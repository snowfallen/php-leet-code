# PHP LeetCode Solutions

![LeetCode Logo](https://leetcode.com/static/images/LeetCode_logo.png)

## Introduction

Welcome to the "php-leet-code" repository! This project aims to provide PHP solutions to various LeetCode problems. LeetCode is a popular platform that offers a wide range of coding challenges to help developers enhance their algorithmic problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three directories, based on the difficulty levels of the problems:

- **Easy**: Contains PHP solutions for LeetCode's easy-level problems.
- **Medium**: Contains PHP solutions for LeetCode's medium-level problems.
- **Hard**: Contains PHP solutions for LeetCode's hard-level problems.

Each problem's solution is stored in its respective directory with a file named "Problem_XXX.php," where "XXX" represents the problem number or a meaningful name.

## How to Contribute

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you'd like to contribute a new solution or improve an existing one, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your contribution: `git checkout -b your-branch-name`.
4. Add your solution file to the appropriate difficulty directory.
5. Ensure your code is well-documented and follows PHP coding standards.
6. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add solution for Problem XXX"`.
7. Push the changes to your forked repository: `git push origin your-branch-name`.
8. Create a pull request (PR) to the main repository. Please provide a detailed description of your contribution in the PR.
