# Reverse Integer https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/description/

## Medium

Given a signed 32-bit integer `number`, return `number` with its digits reversed. If reversing `number` causes the value
to go outside the
signed 32-bit integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then return `0`.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

### Example 1:

```
Input: number = 123
Output: 321
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: number = -123
Output: -321
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: number = 120
Output: 21
```

### Constraints:

* `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`
